          "I got the Shrink Ray! (...) Cotton Candy!\n— Felonius Gru to Dr. Nefario.",
      description: "Felonius Gru is the main protagonist of the Despicable Me franchise.",
      appearance: "Gru is a tall, bald man with blue eyes, long nose and broad, powerful physique; and dresses in a light grey sweater underneath a black collared coat along with a striped grey scarf, black trousers, and shoes, branded Grucci. He has a thick accent, and his arms and legs are notably disproportionate to his body.\nHe is very strong and athletic, being capable of dodging and leaping off several heat-seeking missiles (all going at the speed of sound), backhanding Vector's shark with a single punch (with the apparent force of a truck), and smashing his fist into Vector's monitor, easily cracking the screen without damaging his hand.\nApart from his remarkable agility and strength, Gru is also considerably intelligent. For example, as a child he built a real rocket, although later on his minions and Nefario did most of his work instead. Gru is also capable of forming smart plans, such as his plan to steal the shrink ray from Vector.",
      personality: "At first, Gru was a sneaky and somewhat cold-hearted man, who was determined to become the greatest villain in the world. At first he showed a dislike of children being easily irritated by Agnes, Edith and Margo. He was self-centered and in the beginning, as he only adopted the girls so that he could get the shrink ray which he intended to use to shrink the moon so that he could steal it.\nGru is also rather cruel and even sadistic at first and enjoyed using his Freeze Ray, which is his signature weapon often freezing people just for the sake of it. He is rather warm with his allies, such as Dr. Nefario and also treated his Minions quite well interacting with them and calling each one of them by name (he can also understand their language) instead of just treating them like slaves. However, he also said that he had no intention of giving his minions a raise, though this never caused any protest in them.\nAs time went on, Gru started to enjoy spending time with his three adopted daughters and in the end he grew to genuinely love them, putting aside his dream of stealing the moon and risking his life to rescue them from Vector. Dr. Nefario disapproved of the fact that Gru's warmer side is starting to reveal itself and sent the girls back to the orphanage. Though Gru didn't attempt to stop Miss Hattie from taking them he is clearly upset about them leaving and later said that giving them up is the worst mistake he'd ever made. He also did his best to get to their dance performance after stealing the moon and is upset when he discovered he is too late.\nGru also has a tendency to say 'lightbulb' whenever he has an idea. He speaks in an unusual accent (probably east European) which, according to Steve Carell, was described as 'a mix of Ricardo Montalban and Bela Lugosi'. When asked about his accent by Ellen DeGeneres he said he was from Albuquerque, New Mexico and asked Ellen not to push this topic any further.\nAt the end of the first movie, and throughout the rest of the series, Gru has turned into a softie and became a lot more sweeter, gentler, and friendlier person after adopting Margo, Edith, and Agnes as his own daughters.",
      history: "Gru comes from a long lineage of villains as shown with dozen of statues of his ancestors in Dru's hideout. Although his hometown is unknown, in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres he claimed he was from Albuquerque, New Mexico. Although born with his Twin Brother, Dru Gru, he was separated from Dru in since birth and stayed with his mother Marlena Gru.\nAs a child he had always dreamed of going to the moon. He made a 'prototype' rocket out of macaroni and an actual working prototype rocket. For most of his childhood he was neglected and ignored by his mother. Gru's father, although never in contact with Gru prior to the former's death, was quite proud of Gru's achievements.\nGru was also constantly bullied by other students and one of these events made him afraid of ever asking a girl for a date which is probably the trauma that made him become evil eventually.\nAt some 1968 point, he and his mother visited Villain-Con and met the Dr. Joseph Albert Nefario. Attracted to the scientist's contraptions, he would later employ Nefario, as well as a group of yellow pillow-shaped creatures named Minions he met shortly afterwards. The Minions and Nefario would eventually become his only friends and, differently than the usual villain, he treated them like friends and appreciated every effort they made instead of treating them like slaves.",

      description:
          "Lucy Wilde-Gru , a major character of the Despicable Me franchise. She was a rookie agent of the Anti-Villain League. She is the love interest, later wife of Felonius Gru and adoptive mother to Margo, Edith, and Agnes. She is one of the main characters in the movies Despicable Me 2 and of Despicable Me 3. Beautiful Egypt is also known as her sad theme. Initially assigned to find Gru and bring him to the AVL's headquarters, she, later on, becomes Gru's partner in hunting down the thief of the PX-41 serum.",
      appearance: "Lucy is a woman with green eyes. She has bright red hair that is pulled back in a bun with short bangs. She has fair skin with freckles. Her curved nose is fairly large in comparison to her face. She also has a very thin body. She wears a turquoise spaghetti-strap-slip dress with a white and pink polka-dotted scarf. Sometimes Lucy wears a matching turquoise overcoat over her dress and a pair of matching turquoise sunglasses. She wears silver super high heeled strapped sandal shoes with heels that are an impossible six inches high. It's also seen in the movie that she has red nail polish on her fingernails and toenails.",
      personality: "Lucy, although initially introduced as a serious and stoic woman, is generally very happy, enthusiastic, cheerful, and perky, shown when she exclaims, 'Yay!' after telling Gru she is his new partner. She seems to be quite alert at times, as shown when Gru tried freezing her with his freeze ray, when she quickly (albeit casually, as though done a number of times before) countered this attack with her flamethrower. Lucy is also very athletic and skilled in combat, demonstrated when she accidentally knocked a tray of cupcakes and managed to strike every single one, with 'a combination of jiu-jitsu, Krav Maga, Aztec warfare, and krumping!' although she accidentally flung the remainder of the cupcakes at Gru. She is also shown being a great athlete when she fights Eduardo's guard chicken, El Polito. She might also have some traits of jealousy, shown when she notes Gru is on a date with Shannon and she spies on them. Lucy is also very good at keeping cool in dangerous situations, shown when she hijacked Gru, is attacked by Gru who is using his Freeze Ray. She also remained somewhat cheerful and calm when she is strapped to Eduardo's rocket, although in reality, she is freaking out. Lucy is impatient in traffic, as seen when she is driving on the bridge and doesn't stop for anyone. She probably doesn't like music being on while driving as shown when she slaps Stuart's hand when he turns the radio on. In some points, Lucy is portrayed as attractive and a beautiful person, catching the eyes of Minions like Dave and Stuart. When Agnes first meets Lucy, it is clear that she notices her beauty and then asks her 'Are you single?'. After her marriage to Gru, she does her best to try to bond with the girls. She was initially inept, as she tried to hard or too little in the methods, straining her status with them. However, she later defended the honor of Margo from Niko's Mother, earning the latter's gratitude. She also put herself in harm's way to save the girls from Bratt's destruction of Hollywood. After these events, Lucy was more than pleased to be called 'Mom' by Agnes, happy that she was recognized at being a mother figure to the girls.",
      history: "Lucy's parents were killed by a villain at some point in her life, this event making her join the Anti-Villain League later. Lucy is sent out to recruit Felonius Gru, the former number one villain, and bring him back to the AVL headquarters. Initially requesting the ex-villain to come with her, Lucy is forced to subdue Gru by zapping him with a lipstick taser and shoving him into the trunk of her car. Later, when Gru meets the league director, Lucy's boss Silas Ramsbottom, he apologizes for the abrupt transport to the headquarters. Lucy, however, has no regrets at all, saying the thrill gave her a bit of a buzz. Silas explains about the theft that had occurred with a top-secret lab, which had created PX-41, a mutating chemical compound which could transform anything into an indestructible killing machine. They request Gru, being a former villain, to aid in finding it, but Gru refuses, saying his concerns now are being a father and a legitimate businessman. Before Gru leaves, Lucy tells him she is impressed by his work as a villain, by stating stealing the moon is 'amazing' and asks him, 'Aren't you excited to go back and do something awesome?', and hands him an AVL business card with her number on it, so Gru can call her if he changes his mind. It is shown that she might have a crush on Gru later on in the movie.",

          "Everything is going to be fine. We're gonna be really happy here. Right?\n— Margo to Edith and Agnes",
      description: "Margo Gru is the oldest of the three orphan girls that Gru adopts. Before she was adopted, she was an orphan horribly treated by Miss Hattie. Like Edith and Agnes (Margo's younger sisters), Margo wished to be adopted by somebody who would love them. She is very disapproving of Edith's mischief, shown where Edith jumps in puddles which gets her and Agnes wet, and also when she breaks a vial of acid in Gru's kitchen. She does join in with Edith's antics if it's against someone she doesn't like. She finds it very endearing when Agnes says innocent childlike things (although she does display mild irritation at Agnes' fixation with unicorns), the total opposite of Edith, who finds it irritating. Margo appears in all three of the Despicable Me films and several of the mini movies.",
      appearance: "Margo is a pale-skinned young girl with brown hair that is tied in a ponytail by a white hair tie with bangs tucked to the right side and left side, brown eyes and black square-rimmed glasses. She is seen wearing a black T-shirt with a white button shirt underneath it, a faded green jacket, a navy and purple plaid skirt with white socks and a pair of red and white striped hi-top Converse sneakers. At night for sleeping, she wears an olive green nightgown with black and red at the sleeves and at the bottom, it has the number '87' on it.",
      personality: "Margo tends to be a sensitive and straight to the point girl who is very untrusting of people as she takes a long time to warm up to Felonius Gru and she also does not trust his minions to begin with. She is quite optimistic despite her difficulty trusting people, telling the girls that they will be happy with Gru eventually. When Gru goes after them when they are kidnapped by Vector, she is happy to see him but she is still unsure whether to go back as he gave them away again, but she encouraged Edith and Agnes to jump when Gru makes a heartfelt apology. After he rescues them, she finally accepts him. When Gru told the story of how they changed his life and kisses them goodnight, Margo says that she loves him, finally viewing him as her dad. After Gru married Lucy Wilde, Margo had time accepting her as a mother especially when the latter tried too hard or too little in bonding with her and the others. However, after Lucy defended her from Niko's Mother, did she change her perspective and hugged her for defending her honor. She was also happy Lucy came to rescue her and the others from Bratt's destruction of Hollywood. She has a sarcastic sense of humor and wit, shown especially when Gru says not to touch anything, to which she replies 'Uh huh, what about the floor?' and 'And what about the air?', and she also mocks Gru's accent. She also implies Gru is stupid when he wishes to sell cookies to Vector straight away, whereas they usually go alphabetically- 'We do the A's then the B's and the C's...'. She can be quite judgmental and smart. She is very mature for her apparent age. She sees through Gru's lies about his 'dog' and 'cousins', knowing that Kyle isn't a real dog at all and that his minions clearly aren't human. She outsmarts Gru several times by threatening to cause him grief or bargaining with him to get her own way, one occasion where he refuses to read to them and she says they will disturb all night long. Dru Gru initially believed Margo was 15 years old because she is so mature. She does have a fun loving side, such as throwing toilet paper around Gru's living room and having pillow fights with her sisters, but her highly protective nature towards her younger sisters means she must act the adult often. Margo is very good at ballet, she's the best compared to her younger sisters and enjoys it a lot. Margo also falls for boys, which Gru is very uncomfortable with her doing.",
      history: "Margo is one of the girls staying in Miss Hattie's Home for Girls where she tries to act hopeful to Miss Hattie, but when she reports to her the cookie sales, Miss Hattie is angry and warns Margo and her sisters that if they don't sell enough, they will be put in the Box of Shame. She, along with Edith and Agnes are adopted by Gru. At first, she dislikes him and refuses to accept him as her new father while he doesn't pay this any mind. However, she eventually learned to get along with him, when he takes them to an amusement park. She was amazed when he defended Agnes and won her a prize, while destroying a booth. Margo and Edith approved of this, with both sides learning to care for her in return. Margo and the girls also tell Gru to go through with the moon heist and encourage him to build a rocket. They also bond with Gru's mother who teases him by showing the girls pictures of him as a kid. Their relationship as father and daughter is broken briefly when Dr. Nefario sent her, Edith and Agnes back to Miss Hattie. It is somewhat rebuilt after the girls were kidnapped by Vector who demanded the moon from Gru, in exchange for releasing the girls. Gru delivered the moon, but Vector goes back on his word swearing to give him a beating for it as the girls eagerly await his arrival. Surely enough, Gru easily evades all of Vector's defenses to reach them but Vector flies off in his ship with his captives. While in the sky, Margo noticed the Moon was starting to grow back to normal and alerted her sisters who tried to warn Vector. As the moon grew, its size caused Vector to lose control and fling through the air When Gru comes to their aid, Margo would be forced to jump from Vector's ship during a life-threatening situation. Vector seized her but lost his grip because of the ship and Margo started to fall to the ground while Gru went after her. Once Gru rescued her, she was touched by his kindness and he readopted them as his daughters. At the end, Gru told the girls a story that subtly hints at how happy he is with them in his life. Before leaving, he kissed them on the head but when he got to Margo she got up to hug him and said she loved him finally accepting him as her father. Although shocked at first, Gru is touched by these words and admits he loved her in return.",

      appearance: "Edith has dark bluish-grey eyes, light blonde shaggy cut hair and freckles. She wears a striped pink chullo, even in bed. At first, she is seen wearing a matching sweater with a red skirt and dark purple leggings with dark purple socks and white boots. Later, in the second film, she instead wears a black garb resembling a ninja's with the same boots, only black. She has also begun carrying around a katana. When sleeping, she wears pink pajamas. Her hair is never seen because she is never seen without wearing her knit cap (except if you look at the back of her head, you can see a little bit of blonde hair showing)",
      personality: "Edith is currently the least explored of the three sisters, which is understandable considering she's the middle child, the likes of which are stereotypically neglected by their parents. She shares many traits with Gru, being very destructive, tomboyish and sports a macabre sense of humor. In the beginning, she is reserved and quiet - being opposed to the idea of being an adopted child. Upon seeing all of Gru's weapons and torture devices, her dark, destructive nature is shown when she nonchalantly walks into an iron maiden and starts playing with Gru's dangerous weapons in his lab. She breaks glass bottles with foreign substances in them, plays with Gru's weapons, and at one point pokes at one of the bottles and asks, 'Can I drink this?' at which Dr. Nefario responds with, 'Do you want to explode?'. In response to his answer, she kicks him in the shin and runs off. Edith is also good at ballet, and loves doing it with her sisters. She appears athletic and agile in the second film, and proficient with many weapons and fighting techniques, including the katana and nunchaku. She had also apparently learned Japanese, as she responds in Japanese ('Hai!') when Gru warns her not to destroy anything at the Cinco de Mayo party. She seems to be braver than her two sisters, as she prepared to fight a loose evil minion while her two sisters stayed behind her. She also expresses disgust at open affection, saying 'Can I be the first to say... Eew!' when Margo and Antonio go out on a date with each other, and when Gru and Lucy kiss at their wedding.",
      history: "Not much is known about she and her sisters' past life. Just that some time in their life, they ended up in an orphanage. Miss Hattie, the owner of the orphanage, was a strict ruler, being harsh with the orphans she was supposed to be taking care of. The three of them were forced to spend most of their days walking around selling boxes of cookies, only to be belittled by Miss Hattie upon their return to the orphanage, regardless of how well they did or didn't do. Every night they would pray for someone to adopt them. One day, they sold cookies to Vector, who, at the time, was competing against Gru in stealing the moon. Gru, who had just failed several attempts at breaching Vector's security, looks on in as the three girls are able to walk right into Vector's base. He thinks up a scheme to exploit the girls to steal the shrink ray, which was a key component in both villains' plans to steal the moon, and was in Vector's possession at the time. Not soon after, Gru follows through with his idea and adopts the three girls, and they move into his dark house. While Agnes is ecstatic at having a new father, Edith and Margo are wary of him, though Edith, being a tomboy, finds many 'toys' to play with at Gru's house, including an iron maiden and several weapons, accidentally disintegrating Agnes' unicorn in the process of playing with one of his weapons. At one point Edith asks, 'What does this do?' and breaks a glass bottle containing a potion-like substance of some sort.",

It was put into good use when she protected herself by screaming so loud it cracked Kevin's goggles to give her an opportunity to retrieve her stuffed unicorn (Kevin was mutated due to the PX-41).",
      personality: "Agnes, like her sisters, wished to be adopted by someone who cared about her. At first, Agnes is only one out of the three sisters to be excited to be adopted by Gru. She happily hugs his leg and plays games with him, while her sisters are gawking at Gru, their dream of the 'perfect parents' in tatters. She is unaware of Gru's own dislike of the whole adoption, her innocence prevailing. She is a very naive, sweet, and innocent child, which is why Margo is so protective of her. She thinks Gru's 'dog' is cute and chases after him, despite some protest from Margo. Agnes trusted Gru deeply even though he was, at first, rather cold towards her and her sisters, asking to hold his hand and for him to read her stories. When Gru begins to become more of a parental figure to the girls, her trust in him deepens more. She is the main reason Gru begins to change his ways, her unconditional adoration of him regardless of how he treats her makes him realise what life is really about. She unwittingly sets his change in motion after Gru defends her at the Space Killer blaster game at the amusement park after the attendant mocks her for not winning the game which upsets her, and him — 'Better luck next time' 'OK, my turn'. She is very good at ballet, better than Edith and almost as good as Margo, but lacking her poise. Agnes is also extremely immature and she a very strange obsession with unicorns and wanted to have one for a pet, unaware of the fact that they are mythical creatures. She is not a needy child but does depend on her older sister, Edith, a lot. She often looks worried if Edith walks off ahead of her and runs after Edith, not wanting to be left behind. She also demands Gru fixes her disintegrated toy unicorn, and when she is upset at being mocked by the amusement park game-booth attendant, she looks to Gru with teary eyes for support. When she doesn't get her way, she holds her breath until she does get her way and when she still doesn't get her way by the time she opens her eyes, she pretends to faint, and Margo implies she has done this numerous times before. Agnes has a huge love of candy, wishing her new parents to have a gummy bear house, and happily eats out of the pet food bowl Gru filled with candy. She also made a green disgusting-looking soup with a bit of gummy bears in them, courtesy of her immature behavior, which nearly made Gru and Lucy on the brink of throwing up. She also loves fluffy things for example she called Kyle, Gru's 'dog', a fluffy doggie.",
      history: "Agnes, along with Margo and Edith, attempt to sell to cookies to Felonius Gru, but the girls quickly go away when he pretends to be a recorded message. Agnes leaves believing he is an actual recorded message. The girls return to Miss Hattie's Home for Girls, only to be berated by Miss Hattie for failing to sell the targeted amount of cookies. Within the next few days, Agnes and the girls attempt to sell cookies to Vector, whom, unlike Gru, welcomes them in due to his love for cookies. Soon after, Gru adopts the girls in order to exploit Vector's love of cookies and steal back the Tim (Despicable Me) demeanour. Agnes clings onto Gru's leg in a gesture of playfulness and heads to her new home cheerfully. When she gets there, she also has a similar reaction to Kyle, Gru's 'dog'. Kyle, not used to this sort of behavior, flees in panic. Gru then shows the girls the kitchen and commands them to stay put. Despite that, Agnes, while exploring the house with her sisters, accidentally activates the elevator to Gru's lab. The trio head down and disturb the supervillain while his assistant, Dr. Nefario, is displaying new inventions such as the Cookie Robots. Agnes's unicorn is accidentally disintegrated by Edith, forcing Gru to send the Minions, Tim, Mark, and Phil to get a new one from the local Mal-Mart. The three Minions return with a cheap brush with a cone on the top to resemble the horn, two-eyed and a ball as the nose and a mouth has been drawn, in order to resemble a unicorn-on-a-stick toy, but Agnes is grateful for it and kisses Phil. Agnes, along with Margo and Edith, practices for her Swan Lake ballet recital. During practice, she hands Gru the ticket for the show, making him swear to come with a pinky promise. Soon afterwards, the girls sell Vector cookies again. While they wait for him to pay for the cookies, Agnes asks about why Vector is in his jumpsuit, mistaking them for pajamas, which offends the young supervillain. After selling more cookies around the block, the girls are forced to abandon their cookie delivery at the behest of Gru. Immediately after, Agnes implores Gru to go to Super Silly Fun Land. The supervillain agrees, but only because, having used them to get the shrink ray, he has no further use for them. Gru is forced to ride a roller coaster with the girls, because children aren't allowed to ride it without an adult in the amusement park. Agnes then begs to play Space Killer to win a unicorn stuffed toy — saying, 'It's so fluffy, I'm gonna die!' . The game is rigged however, as they had to 'knock down' a rapidly moving spaceship using little balls, which angers Gru and causes him to volunteer. Gru then uses his blaster and blows up the stand and Agnes wins her unicorn as her sisters open up to Gru who does the same with them and has fun at the park. Returning home, Agnes, Margo, and Edith then play around some more and freeze Gru while he has a video conference with Mr. Perkins. When Mr. Perkins cuts off funding for Gru's plan to steal the Moon due to this incident, Agnes, noticing her adoptive father's despair, offers the girls' piggy bank, which inspires Gru to continue building a rocket needed to go to the Moon. Over time, she becomes closer to Gru and Kyle. Agnes, Margo, and Edith continue to practice for their ballet recital. Soon afterwards, Agnes makes Gru read her favorite bedtime story, Sleepy Kittens. Although the villain hates the book, it makes him realize that he really does love them. Unfortunately, she and her older sisters are later sent back to their old orphanage when Dr. Nefario, believing that they are preventing Gru from concentrating on his job as a villain, called up Miss Hattie. On May 26, the day after, Agnes performs at her recital. Before the show starts, she waits for Gru hopefully but is met with disappointment. Immediately afterwards, they are kidnapped by Vector, and entrapped in a glass ball. The girls are rescued by Gru. Gru, as a token of love, presents to them his new book, One Big Unicorn, which Agnes called the best book ever. Soon afterwards, Agnes, with her sisters, performs another ballet for Gru, or free dancing.",

While Margo and Agnes reached Gru's laboratory safely and met with Edith, Kevin fell into the laboratory from the top. However before he proceeded to attack, he was reverted back into a normal minion by Dr. Nefario, using the PX-49. Delighted to have Kevin back, Minions piled on top of him with joy for his return. Kevin later went with the girls, Dr. Nefario, and other Minions to El Macho's Lair in order to revert the Evil minions back to their regular forms. In the end, Kevin, along with his friends Stuart, Dave, and Jerry, are all dressed in white, singing 'I Swear' at Gru and Lucy's wedding. He appears during the credits promoting the spin-off movie, Minions, along with his friends Bob and Stuart.",

      appearance: "Stuart is a one-eyed short Minion with combed hair. In Despicable Me 2, he is seen dressed up as a girl after Gru is recruited by the Anti-Villain League and sent to Bake My Day to investigate.",
      personality: "Stuart is playful, friendly, intelligent and funny. He is skillful at video games like his friend Dave. He can also be the most sincere and innocent out of all the minions. He also seems to have a rebellious and obstreperous attitude. He is considered to be a slacker among the other Minions, preferring to chill out and play the ukulele than listen to the rules. Also, he was said to be always hungry in Minions, such as when he attempted to eat Kevin and Bob when he was thinking of them as bananas, and even tried to eat a yellow fire hydrant in New York, also thinking it as a banana or food as well.",
      history: "Despicable Me\nStuart and Jerry are asked by Gru to watch Margo, Edith, and Agnes, and keep them away from him. Ultimately, he ends up playing with the girls, throwing toilet paper around in the living room. He is also seen moaning and cheering (when heard that it's not for them) when Gru talks briefly about bedtime.\nDespicable Me 2\nStuart and Phil are cleaning up from Agnes' party when they see Gru being abducted by Lucy. The duo chases after Lucy's car, causing minor havoc in the process, and they end up following her to the AVL after being abducted by her. Stuart and Phil both make fun of the AVL's director, Silas Ramsbottom, because the last part of his last name has the word 'bottom', a word that Minions love to have fun with. Stuart is present along with Dave when Gru works undercover as the owner of a cupcake shop in the Paradise Mall. Stuart disguises himself as a girl, though his dress gets ripped (revealing his pink knickers which came with the disguise), which forces him to hide in a flower pot out of embarrassment. Stuart is later shown with the rest of the Minions having an ice cream party when Gru arrives and asks him and Dave to come with him. When Gru and Lucy are investigating Eduardo's restaurant Salsa & Salsa, Stuart is waiting by the car outside together with Dave. When Dave gets the call from Gru to rescue him and Lucy, Dave acts right away, crashing through the malls entrance with Stuart on the gas pedal, Dave and Stuart failed to pull over for Gru and Lucy twice, but saved them in time before Eduardo caught them. Lucy opens the car door and is greeted by Dave and Stuart (who seems to have a crush on her as well, as shown when Stuart pushes the accelerator). It is possible that Stuart is the minion Gru was practicing with, when he tried to ask Lucy out on a date (Although Gru stated that the Minion's not helping). After Dr. Nefario tells Gru that Eduardo has kidnapped Lucy, Gru forcibly grabs both Stuart and Dave – who are at the middle of a video game – to follow him to rescue Lucy. Gru disguises Stuart and Dave in purple paint to pass them off as Evil Minions escorting a seemingly captured Gru into El Macho's lair in a rescue attempt. However, the plan fails due to Dave accidentally ruining his own disguise by attempting to communicate with the Evil Minions and part of his paint vanishes. In the end, Stuart, along with his friends Dave, Kevin, and Jerry, are dressed in white, singing 'I Swear' at Gru and Lucy's wedding.
